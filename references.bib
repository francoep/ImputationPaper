    abstract = {Recently, numerous studies have been conducted on Missing Value Imputation (MVI), intending the primary solution scheme for the datasets containing one or more missing attribute’s values. The incorporation of MVI reinforces the Machine Learning (ML) models’ performance and necessitates a systematic review of MVI methodologies employed for different tasks and datasets. It will aid beginners as guidance towards composing an effective ML-based decision-making system in various fields of applications. This article aims to conduct a rigorous review and analysis of the state-of-the-art MVI methods in the literature published in the last decade. Altogether, 191 articles, published from 2010 to August 2021, are selected for review using the well-known Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique. We summarize those articles with relevant definitions, theories, and analyses to provide essential information for building a precise decision-making framework. In addition, the evaluation metrics employed for MVI methods and ML-based classification models are also discussed and explored. Remarkably, the trends for the MVI method and its evaluation are also scrutinized from the last twelve years’ data. To come up with the conclusion, several ML-based pipelines, where the MVI schemes are incorporated for performance enhancement, are investigated and reviewed for many different datasets. In the end, informative observations and recommendations are addressed for future research directions and trends in related fields of interest.}

    abstract = {Abstract Analysis of high-resolution data offers greater opportunity to understand the nature of data variability, behaviours, trends and to detect small changes. Climate studies often require complete time series data which, in the presence of missing data, means imputation must be undertaken. Research on the imputation of high-resolution temporal climate time series data is still at an early phase. In this study, multiple approaches to the imputation of missing values were evaluated, including a structural time series model with Kalman smoothing, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with Kalman smoothing and multiple linear regression. The methods were applied to complete subsets of data from 12 month time series of hourly temperature, humidity and wind speed data from four locations along the coast of Western Australia. Assuming that observations were missing at random, artificial gaps of missing observations were studied using a five-fold cross-validation methodology with the proportion of missing data set to 10\%. The techniques were compared using the pooled mean absolute error, root mean square error and symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The multiple linear regression model was generally the best model based on the pooled performance indicators, followed by the ARIMA with Kalman smoothing. However, the low error values obtained from each of the approaches suggested that the models competed closely and imputed highly plausible values. To some extent, the performance of the models varied among locations. It can be concluded that the modelling approaches studied have demonstrated suitability in imputing missing data in hourly temperature, humidity and wind speed data and are therefore recommended for application in other fields where high-resolution data with missing values are common.},

State of the art performance is currently achieved by the allele-specific predictor NetMHC and the pan-allele predictor NetMHCpan, both of which are ensembles of shallow neural networks. We explore an intermediate between allele-specific and pan-allele prediction: training allele-specific predictors with synthetic samples generated by imputation of the peptide-MHC affinity matrix. We find that the imputation strategy is useful on alleles with very little training data. We have implemented our predictor as an open-source software package called MHCflurry and show that MHCflurry achieves competitive performance to NetMHC and NetMHCpan.},

    abstract = {Abstract Objective To assess the feasibility of applying machine learning (ML) methods to imputation in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Data Sources All data come from the 2016–2017 MEPS. Study Design Currently, expenditures for medical encounters in the MEPS are imputed with a predictive mean matching (PMM) algorithm in which a linear regression model is used to predict expenditures for events with (donors) and without (recipients) data. Recipient events and donor events are then matched based on the smallest distance between predicted expenditures, and the donor event's expenditures are used as the recipient event's imputation. We replace linear regression algorithm in the PMM framework with ML methods to predict expenditures. We examine five alternatives to linear regression: Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Extreme Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and a Stacked Ensemble approach. Additionally, we introduce an alternative matching scheme, which matches on a vector of predicted expenditures by sources of payment instead of a single total expenditure prediction to generate potentially superior matches. Data Collection Study data is derived from a large federal survey. Principal Findings ML algorithms perform better at both prediction and matching imputation than Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), the most common prediction algorithm used in PMM. On average, the Stacked Ensemble approach that combines all the ML algorithms performs best, improving expenditure prediction R2 by 108\% (0.156 points) and final imputation R2 by 227\% (0.397 points). Matching on a prediction vector also improves alignment of sources of payments between donor and recipient events. Conclusions ML algorithms and an alternative matching scheme improve the overall quality of expenditure PMM imputation in the MEPS. These methods may have additional value in other national surveys that currently rely on PMM or similar methods for imputation.},
